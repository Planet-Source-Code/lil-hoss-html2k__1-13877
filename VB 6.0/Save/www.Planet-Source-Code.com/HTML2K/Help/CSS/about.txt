The Web Design Group's CSS Reference help file is intended to provide
a quick overview of all CSS properties, their values and brief 
descriptions.

The help file includes:
 - Introduction to Style Sheets
 - Quick Tutorial
 - CSS Structure and Rules  
 - CSS Properties Reference
 - Methods of Linking Style Sheets to HTML
 - CSS References  

Each property has full annotations regarding appearance, and possible values. 
All properties are fully hyperlinked to allow for quick and easy navigation
from one property to another, and a searchable index and table of contents
are only a click away.

The file is available for Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and a Mac version is 
currently in the works.  The WDG encourages suggestions and requests from 
end users in regards to the content of the help file, or additions they would 
like to see implemented.

The help file is freely available to all users, and the WDG has a set of 
guidelines for distribution and commercial uses of the file availalble at:
